# ðŸ§® Sudoku Solver using Linked List (C Project)

A simple yet efficient **Sudoku Solver** implemented in **C** that uses a **linked list** to manage empty cells dynamically.  
This project was created as part of a **Data Structures Mini Project** to demonstrate recursion, backtracking, and linked list manipulation.

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Solve any valid 9x9 Sudoku puzzle automatically.
- Play manually and fill the Sudoku board interactively.
- Dynamic tracking of empty cells using a linked list.
- Well-structured modular code (with safe memory handling and backtracking).
- Console-based interface for ease of testing.

## ðŸ§  How It Works
1. The initial Sudoku board is stored in a 9x9 2D array.
2. A **linked list** (`Node`) stores coordinates of all empty cells.
3. The `solve_with_list()` function uses **recursive backtracking**:
   - It iterates through each empty cell.
   - Tries valid numbers (1â€“9) using the `is_safe()` function.
   - Backtracks when a placement violates Sudoku rules.
4. Once solved, the board is displayed neatly with borders.
